genico
======

Generate icons automatically, so you don't have to.

## Background

The inspiration for this project comes from [audreyr](https://github.com/audreyr)/[favicon-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/audreyr/favicon-cheat-sheet).  The process of properly creating favicons for a website used to painfully time consuming.  Now there is genico.


## Setup

Genico runs on Ruby and requires ImageMagick.

1. Install the ImageMagick native libraries
```sh
sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev
```

2. Install RMagick, the binding from Ruby to ImageMagick
```sh
gem install rmagick 
```
